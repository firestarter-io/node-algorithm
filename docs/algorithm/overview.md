# Overview

The Algorithm section of these docs explain the fundamental principles of the fire spread logic. They are based heavily on long-used scientific research surrounding mathematical models of fire spread. They are more specific to the logic extracted from physical principles than they are to the in-code implementation. For more details on in-code implementations, see the Components section.
